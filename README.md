**Requirements:** Your assignment is to create an interactive food diary that allows users to record the different food shelf details for the day, and to record the date. You do not need to create a database, etc. just work on the "front end", i.e. the food pyramid and interactive elements.

You must use HTML elements to create the chart - you may not use images to create the structure of the individual components (trapezoids and triangle) layered as a pyramid, i.e. you cannot just create an image, load it and overlay it with the interactive components. Colour and other styling settings must be achieved using CSS. You must use "pure" Javascript only. Do not use jQuery, or any Javascript framework. 

The food pyramid must have the following interactive functionality: 
- It should provide an indicator showing the number of items consumed for a particular shelf, for example in the figure shown, it shows 6 itmes on the green shelf. 
- It should also include buttons (or similar devices) to increase and decrease the number of items on the shelf.
- The (+ / -) buttons (controls) should only appear when you hover over a particular shelf.
- The shelf numbers should always be displayed.
- You should also have some interactive method for inputting the date for the daily record. You do not need to validate the date.
- There must be break in between the top two shelves.
